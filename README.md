# SiPM-Readout-Board
Files for building a 4-channel SiPM Readout Board. Multiple boards can be cascaded together.

Files created using Altium 16.0

Schematics:
Connectors.SchDoc is the top sheet on which other sheets are dependent
Channel_1.SchDoc for Channel 1 design
Channel_2.SchDoc for Channel 2 design
Channel_3.SchDoc for Channel 3 design
Channel_4.SchDoc for Channel 4 design
Coincidence.SchDoc for design of the coincidence selection and trigger generation circuit
